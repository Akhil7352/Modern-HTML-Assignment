<!-- Ans -->

<!-- Accessibility in Web Development-

Definition:- Accessibility in web development (often abbreviated as a11y) refers to the practice of making websites usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities such as visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

Why it is essential:-

1. Legal requirements.
2. Better UX:- Often improves usability for all users, not just those with disabilities
3. SEO benefits:- Accessible sites tend to rank better in search engines
4. Broader audience:- Reaches more potential customers/users

Benefits for different user groups:-
1. Visually impaired: Screen readers can interpret properly structured content
2. Hearing impaired: Captions and transcripts for audio/video content
3. Cognitive disabilities: Clear layouts and consistent navigation help understanding
4. Elderly users: Larger text and good contrast aid readability -->


<!-- Que 4. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML. -->
<!-- Ans -->

<!-- Ways to Improve HTML Accessibility:- 
1. Use semantic HTML: Properly structured headings (<h1> to <h6>) and semantic elements (<nav>, <main>, <article>, etc.)
2. Provide text alternatives: alt attributes for images, captions for videos
3. Ensure keyboard navigability: All interactive elements should be focusable and usable with keyboard alone -->


<!-- Que 5. Create a web page that highlights the features of HTML5. Use appropriate semantic tags to structure the content and showcase at least three key features of HTML5 with explanations. -->

            <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
            <p>HTML5 introduced semantic elements that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and developer.
                <br>
                Tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> make the HTML more readable
                and improve accessibility and SEO.

        <article>
            <h2>Audio and Video Support</h2>
            <p>Before HTML5, audio and video could only be played in a browser with plugins.
                HTML5 introduced <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements for
                embedding media directly in web pages.</p>
            <!-- HTML5 2nd use case -->
            <video width="320" height="240" controls muted autoplay>

            <!-- HTML5 3rd use case -->
            <h2>SVG Support</h2>
            <p>HTML5 has built-in support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which allows for resolution-independent
                graphics that can scale to any size without losing quality. SVG graphics are defined in XML format and
                can be styled with CSS.</p>
